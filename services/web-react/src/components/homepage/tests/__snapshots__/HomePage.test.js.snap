            Ruby on Rails come with three environments by default – development, testing and production. But sooner or later one has a need for staging environment. And don’t get me wrong, you can (or should?) use the production settings there, but if you run it locally or on the same server as production, chances are you need a different database. And while you are at it, it may be handy to allow logging to console or change any other of Rails settings for that matter. In fact you can create as many other environments as you want and since it’s really easy I encourage you to do so.
        
        To create a new environment you need to create:
        
        a new config/environments/YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.rb file
        a new database configuration entry in config/database.yml if your application uses database
        a new secret key base entry in config/secrets.yml for apps on Rails 4.1 and higher
        As I mentioned first we would need a new file in config/environments/. A short example for staging environment could be:

It started with a simple refactoring. We allow people to post arbitrary URLs in Basecamp 3’s chat, which we’ll attempt to fetch and display inline, if its an image, movie, or a Twitter URL. There’s a security concern where we don’t want to allow internal IPs in those URLs, like 127.0.0.1, and then have our Downloader class attempt to trigger an internal request that may sidestep other security precautions.

No problemo: Just extract the protection into its own module and call it from both spots. First attempt at naming this new module gave me PrivateNetworkProtector, which seemed like a fine choice until I considered the method names that’d work with it:

    Ruby on Rails come with three environments by default – development, testing and production. But sooner or later one has a need for staging environment. And don’t get me wrong, you can (or should?) use the production settings there, but if you run it locally or on the same server as production, chances are you need a different database. And while you are at it, it may be handy to allow logging to console or change any other of Rails settings for that matter. In fact you can create as many other environments as you want and since it’s really easy I encourage you to do so.

To create a new environment you need to create:

a new config/environments/YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.rb file
a new database configuration entry in config/database.yml if your application uses database
a new secret key base entry in config/secrets.yml for apps on Rails 4.1 and higher
As I mentioned first we would need a new file in config/environments/. A short example for staging environment could be:

We allow people to post arbitrary URLs in Basecamp 3’s chat, which we’ll attempt to fetch and display inline, if its an image, movie, or a Twitter URL. There’s a security concern where we don’t want to allow internal IPs in those URLs, like 127.0.0.1, and then have our Downloader class attempt to trigger an internal request that may sidestep other security precautions.

Because just like with previewable chat URLs, webhooks allow users to set URLs that our system then calls. Same underlying security issue to deal with.

In fact you can create as many other environments as you want and since it’s really easy I encourage you to do so.
